## Probability

```yaml

```

`@part1`
- Foundation of Data Science {{1}}
- Allows to produce data from models {{2}}
- Study regularities in random phenomena {{3}}


`@script`
Probability is the foundation of many of the methods and models in Data science. Statistical inference methods start from data to talk about the underlying process that produces the data. The models will try to replicate that underlying process.

Probability is the study of the regularities that arises in random phenomena. That way you can generate data from a model, using simulation.

My name is Alexander Ramirez and I will host the Foundations of Probability with Python course.

## Gain intuition with coin flips

`@script`
We want to gain intuition about Probability starting with the classic random experiment, a coin flip.

To study Probability we will start simulating random experiments with Python and along the way we will get intuition about how to calculate probabilities, some probability distributions and key results. So let´s start flipping coins!!!

## Only two outcomes

### Heads or Tails

![Heads or Tails](https://synergy.vision/assets/datacamp/images/coin-head-and-tail-riddle.jpg)


`@script`
Each time you flip a coin there are only two possible outcomes, Heads or Tails.

You dont know what you are going to get beforehand. In this case your experiment is the flip of a coin, the possible outcomes are Heads or Tails. The actual outcome after flipping the coin we will call it an event.

You assign probabilities to events. In a fair coin you have a probability of 0.5 (50% chance) of getting Heads and a probability of 0.5 (50% chance) of getting Tails on each draw.

## Let's practice flipping coins with Python.

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "b5e79052e2"
```

`@script`
We can make more experiments like this and get a sense about the outcomes that are more likely. Before that, lets practice flipping some coins with Python.

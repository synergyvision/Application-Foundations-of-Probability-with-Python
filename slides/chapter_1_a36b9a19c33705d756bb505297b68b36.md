## Probability

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5dc993b465"
```

`@part1`
- Foundation of Data Science {{1}}
- Allows to produce data from models {{2}}
- Study regularities in random phenomena {{3}}


`@script`
Probability is the foundation of many of the methods and models in Data science. Statistical inference methods start from data to talk about the underlying process that produces the data. The models will try to replicate that process.

Probability is the study of the regularities that arises in random phenomena. That way you can generate data from a model, using simulation.

My name is Alexander Ramirez and I will host the Foundations of Probability with Python course.

## Gain intuition

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3e1314b75d"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
...with coin flips {{1}}

![Coin toss](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/3758/datasets/5d0d5f4e14e6109d612eaa697f9d0ba6e369e324/coin-toss2.jpg){{1}}


`@script`
We want to gain intuition about Probability starting with the classic random experiment, a coin flip.

To study Probability we will start simulating random experiments with Python and along the way we will get intuition about how to calculate probabilities, some probability distributions and key results. So let´s start flipping coins!!!

## Only two outcomes

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a83446a9f2"
center_content: true
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
Heads or Tails {{1}} 

![Heads or Tails](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/3758/datasets/f20ded894493cc77a61e7e15885830e015521b0f/coin-head-and-tail-riddle.jpg){{1}}


`@script`
Each time you flip a coin there are only two possible outcomes, Heads or Tails.

You dont know what are you going to get beforehand. In this case your experiment is the flip of a coin, the possible outcomes are Heads or Tails. The actual outcome after flipping the coin we will call it an event.

You assign probabilities to events. In a fair coin you have a probability of 0.5 (50% chance) of getting Heads and a probability of 0.5 (50% chance) of getting Tails on each draw.

## Flipping a coin with Python

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "bb679960fe"
```

`@part1`
Bernoulli random experiment {{1}}
```
from scipy.stats import bernoulli
bernoulli.rvs(0.5, size=1)
array([0])
``` {{1}}

Another draw {{2}}
```
bernoulli.rvs(0.5, size=1)
array([1])
```{{2}}


`@script`
To simulate the coin flips, we will use the `scipy.stats` Python library. We do not need a coin, with Python we can simulate each draw.

We will use the bernoulli object from `scipy.stats` library to simulate a fair coin flip.

We will call bernoulli.rvs specifying two arguments. The first being the probability of getting heads, the second being the number of coin flips in the size argument. For the first we will specify 0.5 for a fair coin and for size we will specify 1, for a single coin flip.

As in a real coin we have two possible outcomes, 0 or 1. In this case we got 0 or Tails.

We can run the instruction many times to appreciate the different outcomes.

When we study Probability the idea is to find regularities that allow us to infer from data. So let’s make more than one experiment.

## Flipping multiple coins

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a238964c57"
```

`@part1`
Change size to flip more… {{1}}
```
bernoulli.rvs(0.5, size=10)
array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0])
```{{1}}

How many heads? {{2}}
```
sum(bernoulli.rvs(0.5, size=10))
5
```{{2}}

Another draw...{{3}}
```
sum(bernoulli.rvs(0.5, size=10))
2
```{{3}}


`@script`
If we want to simulate 10 coin flips we will specify the size as 10.

We will consider 1 as Heads and we can use sum to know how many heads we got after 10 coin flips.

We got 5 heads and 5 tails.

After another draw we got 2 heads and 8 tails. So we can see that after a draw we got different results.

## Flipping multiple coins

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "f6a77b8b24"
```

`@part1`
Binomial random variable{{1}}
```
from scipy.stats import bins
binom.rvs(10, 0.5, size=1)
array([7])
```{{1}}
Many draws{{2}}
```
binom.rvs(10, 0.5, size=10)
array([6, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 6, 6])
```{{2}}
Biased coin draws{{3}}
```
binom.rvs(10, 0.3, size=10)
array([3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6])
```{{3}}


`@script`
There is another way to make the experiment using the binomial distribution and the binom object from scipy.stats.

We will use three arguments, first the number of coin flips, second the probability of getting heads and third the size that specify how many draws we want.

Now we got 7 heads out of 10 coin flips. Now lets try again.
As we can see 5 is the result that repeats more often. 

We have been working with fair coins, but we could change the probability to 0.3.

As you may notice already, we can appreciate different outcomes using biased coins.

## Let's practice flipping coins with Python.

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "b5e79052e2"
```

`@script`
We can make more experiments like this and get a sense about the outcomes that are more likely. Before that, lets practice flipping coins with Python.

## Probability

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5dc993b465"
```

`@part1`
- Foundation of Data Science {{1}}
- Allows to produce data from models {{2}}
- Study regularities in random phenomena {{3}}


`@script`
Probability is the foundation of many of the methods and models in Data science. Statistical inference methods start from data to talk about the underlying process that produces the data. The models will try to replicate that underlying process.

Probability is the study of the regularities that arises in random phenomena. That way you can generate data from a model, using simulation.

My name is Alexander Ramirez and I will host the Foundations of Probability with Python course.

## Let's practice flipping coins with Python.

```yaml

`@script`
We can make more experiments like this and get a sense about the outcomes that are more likely. Before that, lets practice flipping some coins with Python.

title: 'Let’s start flipping coins'
description: 'A coin flip is the classical example of a random experiment. The possible outcomes are head or tails. This experiment allow us to study problems with two possible outcomes, like “yes” or “no” and “vote” or “no vote” situations. This chapter will allow you to learn about bernoulli experiments and binomial distributions which models multiple bernoulli trials and probability calculation using simulation with Python scipy library.'
